  "body": " Introduction   A review of terminology to understand statistics.     At the end of this section you will able to:    Identify the cases and variables in a data set.    Distinguish between a sample and a poplulation.    Classify variables as qualitative or quantitative.      You may ask yourself, what is statistics? Will I ever need it? Statistics is all around us. If you are a sports fan, you have heard phrases like average passing yards in a football game, the proportion of free-throws in basketball, or the batting average in baseball. Around election time you hear about polls predicting the president using terms like margin of error. Environmentalists may gather data on arsenic levels in the water of a town or analyze the increasing global temperatures. These are but a few ways statistics is used.   Statistics is the science of conducting studies to collect, organize, analyze and interpret data.  We are going to use an investigative approach to learning about statistics. We will look at different ways of collecting data (such as with surveys and questionnaires). We will organize the data with graphs and tables so we can see what the data tells us at a glance. We will describe the data with numerical summaries (known as statistics) and word descriptions. Later in the semester we will look at other ways to analyze data, such as finding intervals to predict a typical value and compare whether the sample is similar or different from previously known values. We will also investigate if there is an association between variables.  To begin this journey, let us look at some vocabulary commonly associated with statistics.   A case is the unit of observation, typically a person or object that you are interested in finding information about.    A variable is a characteristic that can assume different values, the measurement or observation about the case (unit).     Data are the values or measurements the variables assume.    For example , what are the majors for the students in your class? The major is the variable since there are multiple responses from the students (such as math major, history major, education, nursing, biology major). Other variables you can ask students in your class are their grade level (freshman, sophomore, junior, senior) and the number of credit hours taken this semester. If we asked the students (each student is a case) in class, there will be lots of different answers for the majors (thus the data).     Checkpoint: Dr. Steve Mackessy has been researching snake venom. Suppose he collects data from a sample of 5 snakes. He measures the length and weight of each snake, identifies the species of snake, and the amount of myotoxin A from its venom, if applicable. Identify the cases and variables in this scenario.    Identify the cases  Which of the following are the cases in this scenario? Select all statements that apply.     The five snakes.    Yes, each snake is a case.      The length and weight of the snakes.    The length and weight are variables.      The amount of myotoxin A.    amount of myotoxin A is a variable.       Identify the variables  Which of the following are the variables in this scenario? Select all statements that apply.     The snakes.    No, each snake is a case.      The length and weight of the snakes.    Yes, the length and weight are variables.      The amount of myotoxin A.    Yes, the amount of myotoxin A is a variable.      The name of the species.    Yes, species is a variable since some may be rattlesnakes and some could be bull snakes.     There are two key terms we use to distinguish the groups we collect data from:   The population is the set of all subjects in the study.    A sample is a group or subset of subjects selected from the population.   If we asked ALL residents of the state of Colorado where they were born, then the Colorado residents would be the population. But if we asked just some people from a single city in the state of Colorado, they would a sample from the state.   Checkpoint: At the Denver Zoo, every animal gets a yearly checkup. The new veterinarian selects 20 female animals to determine if they are pregnant in the spring.    Identify the population  What is the population?     Every animal at the Denver Zoo.    Yes, every animal makes the population.      The 20 female animals.    No, the 20 female animals is the sample.     There are two main branches of statistics that we are interested in.  In descriptive statistics the statistician tries to describe a situation. It consists of collecting, organizing, summarizing and presenting the data.  While with inferential statistics the statisticians make inferences from samples to make predictions about the population. It consists of generalizing data from samples, performing estimations and hypothesis testing, determining relationships among variables, and making predictions.  We will begin with descriptive statistics since we will summarize the data to make the inferences.   Example: According to the Center for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) for the week January 9, 2021, there were 25,974 deaths in the United States attributed to COVID. This is descriptive since it is stating the total deaths.   Example: According to a 2023 Pew Research Center study, approximately 32% of Americans have at least one tattoo. This is inferential since the since they are assuming what is true for the population from a sample study. It is unlikey they asked the entire populuation how many tatoos they have.    Identify if each situation is descriptive or inferential statistics:    Identify if descriptive or inferential statistic  It is estimated that about 9% of the people in the United States have green eyes.     inferential statistic.    Yes, they used a sample to predict the population proportion.      descriptive statistic.    Since they are estimating, its inferential. It is unlikey they asked every US citizen their eye color.     Identify if descriptive or inferential statistic  There are 125 women in the US House of Representatives in 2025.     descriptive statistic.    Yes, its a descriptive statistsic.      inferential statistics.    This is descriptive since it is summarizing the actual count.     Identify if descriptive or inferential statistic  In 2025, 26% of the United States Senators are women.     descriptive statistic.    Yes, since 26 of the 100 senators are women, its descriptive.      inferential statistics.    Since 26 of the 100 senators are women, its descriptive.     There are two main types of data we will be working with:   Qualitative variables are when the data are placed into distinct categories. Such as the color of cars found in a parking lot. The car colors can be classified as white, red, blue, black and other colors.   Quantitative variables are numerical and can be ordered. There are two types of quantitative variables. Discrete variables can be counted, such as the number of cars in the different parking lots across campus. The values are whole numbers. Other numerical variables are continuous variables , meaning any value (decimal or fraction) can occur. These are often obtained by measuring something. A continuous variable could be the length of the cars in the parking lot or the time it takes a car to stop when traveling 20 miles per hour. The numberical value can be something besides a whole number.    Identify the type of variable  Identify which variables are qualitative (categorical). Check all that apply.     The size of drinks at a fast-food restaurant as small, medium, or large.    Yes, since categories of small, medium, large.      Classification of children in a daycare center as infant, toddler, or preschooler.    Yes, since categories given.      The weight of the students in class.    Weight will be a number like 150 pounds.     Identify the type of variable  Identify which variables are quantitative (numerical)     The height of players on the UNC basketball team.    Height is quantitative.      The number of free-throws made during a basketball game.    yes, number of free-throws is quantitative.      The type of candy in the vending machine.    Type of candy is categorical.       Classify the quantitative variable  Identify which quantitative variables are discrete.     number of muffins purchased each day at a local bakery.    Number of muffins is discrete (cannot sell half a muffin).      The quantity of touchdowns during a football game.    Number of touchdowns is discrete.      The weight of the students in class.    Weight is continuous since someone can weigh 150.3 pounds.     Classify the quantitative variable  Identify which quantitative variables are continuous.     The height of the basketball players.    Height is continuous (6.8 feet tall).      Time to complete the 100 meter breaststroke.    Time is continuous.      The weights of newborn infants at local hospital.    Weight is continuous.      Exercise: In 2010, the Pew Research Center questioned 1500 adults in the U.S. to estimate the proportion of the population favoring marijuana use for medical purposes. It was found that 73% are in favor of using marijuana for medical purposes. Identify the case, variable, type of data collected, population, and sample from this scenario.  Vocabulary Identification  Drag the case, variable, population, and sample to the description from the marijuana scenario.    Cases  Each U.S. adult that responded    Variable  The question “should marijuana be used for medical purposes?”    Population  The set of all adults in the U.S    Sample  The 1500 U.S. adults that responded    "

  "body": " Collecting Data    At the end of this section you will able to:    Simulate several sampling methods.    Recognize the type sampling methods employed in a study.      Recall that the population is the set of all subjects for the study, while a sample is a group or subset selected from the population. It is often difficult or too expensive to examine the whole population for a study, thus we use a sample to help us draw conclusions about the population. When we choose a sample, we want it to be as similar to the population as possible. We are going to simulate several sampling methods using Gettysburg’s Address as the population.  President Abraham Lincoln delivered one of the most famous speeches in United States history at the dedication of the Gettysburg National Cemetery on November 19, 1863. After the featured speaker spoke for two hours, Lincoln delivered his 269-word message in approximately two minutes. Our goal is to estimate the average word length in Abraham Lincoln’s Gettysburg Address by selecting a sample of ten words. The entire text of Lincoln’s Gettysburg Address is given below.  Step 1: Your task is to select a sample of 10 words to estimate the average length of words in his speech. Pick words that appear to be representative of the population of all the words. If you print the address, you can circle the ten words you choose.  Step 2: Find the lengths (number of letters) for each of the 10 words you selected.  Step 3: Calculate the average number of letters for the 10 words in your sample. Take the total number of letters and divide by the 10 words for the average.  The image below is a class distribution of the average number of letters per word for the Gettysburg Address. We can see the values range from 3 to 8 with the center around 5.5, thus this will be our predicted value for the typical word length. But it turns out, we are often biased in the words we select. Some students selected bigger words to be representative. Did you notice how many two and three letter words there were? Were you bias??   Sampling bias occurs when the method of selecting a sample causes the sample to differ from the population in some relevant way. If sampling bias exists, we cannot trust generalizations from the sample to the population. So, we need a better method for predicting the typical or average value.  There are many sampling techniques, we will look at some of the more common sampling methods in statistics.   Simple Random Sample is a method in which every element in the population has an equal chance of being selected for the sample. It’s like putting all the names of the students in class in a hat and randomly drawing ten names.   Systematic Sampling is a method that useful when the population is already ordered in some way and every kth item is selected. While standing in line at a game, every 10th person gets a 10% off coupon. There is a system in how the sample is collected.   Stratified Sampling occurs when the population is divided into natural groups or strata. People are randomly polled in each group and the number of people polled in each group is determined by the ratio of the group to size of the total population. When sampling for how students study, the sample should consist of some freshman, sophomore, juniors, and seniors. If there are twice as many freshman as seniors, then the sample would also have twice as many freshman.   Cluster Sampling is a method that randomly selects a naturally occurring group or cluster and all in that cluster are selected. This is common in education where all of one class is selected to participate in the study. It is helpful to think of a cluster of grapes: you take the whole cluster rather than just grabbing a couple of grapes.   Convenience Sampling occurs when a group of subjects are convenient to sample. Around election time, people stand outside grocery stores to gather easy sample of people.   Exercise: Identify the type of sampling method described for each scenario:  Sampling Methods Matching Problem  Match the type of sampling method described with the appropriate scenario. Drag the sampling method name to the description.    Systematic Sampling  Alfred is conducting a survey to determine who students will vote for as their next Student Affairs President. He decided to survey students in a dormitory and knocks on every 10th door    Simple Random Sample  Betty is conducting a survey to determine if students like the new plus\/minus grading system. She randomly draws 100 bear numbers from a list and surveys those students.    Stratified Sampling  Charlotte is conducting a survey to determine if students make use of the campus recreation center. She polls 100 freshman, 100 sophomores, 100 juniors, and 100 seniors on how frequently they use the recreation center.    Cluster Sampling  Eugene is conducting a survey to determine if the dorms should have more study break sessions during finals week. He asks everyone on the 5th floor of Turner their opinion.    Convenience Sampling  Douglas is conducting a survey to determine if the University Center should open up a McDonalds, Wendy’s, or Burger King. He stands outside the UC and surveys students as they enter the building.    "

Experimental studies where the researcher manipulates a variable to determine how the treatment influences the other variables.

Observational study    Yes, an observational study because they are looking at the records, not manipulating a variable.      Experimental study    They are not manipulating a variable.     Identify the type of study described  Identify the type of study described: A sample of 50 men with high triglyceride levels were randomly assigned to two groups: consumed 2 tablespoons of oat bran daily for 6 weeks or consumed 2 tablespoons of wheat bran for 6 weeks, to determine which bran worked better to lower their triglyceride levels.     Experimental study    Yes, they are manipulating a variable.      Observational study    Experimental since they are manipulating a variable.     Many observational studies involve surveys and questionnaires, which uses questions to collect the data for the study. Others look at historical records to collect the data. In educational environment, observations of the participants is how the data is collected, by jotting down notes or videotaping the behaviors.  There are three main types of variables we will look at within an experimental study.  The independent variable is the variable that is being manipulated by the researchers. It is also called the explanatory variable.  The dependent variable is the result of manipulation. It is also called the response variable.  A confounding variable is one that influences the dependent variable but cannot be separated from the independent variable.  For this example, identify the variables. A sample of 50 men with high triglyceride levels were randomly assigned to two groups: one consumed 2 tablespoons of oat bran daily for 6 weeks and the other group consumed 2 tablespoons of wheat bran for 6 weeks, to determine which bran worked better to lower their triglyceride levels.    Identify the type of variable  What variable is the type of bran the participants consumed?     independent variable    Yes, because they want to see if the type of bran influences the triglyceride level.      dependent variable    No, the dependent variable is the resulting triglyceride level.      confounding variable    There were no confounding variable listed, but a person’s diet and health may influence the results.       Identify the type of variable  What variable is the triglyceride levels?     dependent variable    Yes, checking to see if triglyceride level changes.      independent variable    No, the independent variable is the type of bran.      confounding variable    There were no confounding variables listed, but the amount of time a person exercises may influence the results.     Type of bran consumed is the independent variable. They want to determine which one works better in lowering the triglyceride levels.  Whether or not the triglyceride level changes is the dependent variable. This is the result of the of manipulating which type of bran they consumed.  In this case, both bran groups were in the treatment group, there was not control group in the study.  There are several possible confounding variables in this study. Things that could influence the triglyceride levels could be diet, amount of exercise, current healthy, and weight of the participants.  There are many ways experimental studies can be conducted. We will look at some of the most common for this course.  In a Randomized Two-treatment Experiment there are typically two treatments and the individuals are randomly placed into the two groups. Either both groups get a treatment, or one group gets a treatment and the other gets either nothing or a placebo. The group getting either no treatment or the placebo is called the control group . The group getting the treatment is called the treatment group . A doctor may be comparing two different diabetes mediations. The subjects are randomly assigned which medication to use for the study.  The purpose of the placebo is that a person thinks they are receiving the treatment, but in reality, they are receiving a sugar pill or fake treatment. Doing this helps to account for the placebo effect , which is where a person thinks their body responds favorable to a treatment because they are in the study even though they are not really taking the treatment. Not every experiment needs a placebo, such as when working using animals, plants, or children. Also, it is not always possible to use a placebo or no treatment. As an example, if you are testing a new blood pressure medication you cannot give a person with high blood pressure a placebo or no treatment because of health or moral reasons.  In a Randomized Block Design a group of subjects (considered the block) that are similar in some aspects are randomly assigned to a treatment. Everyone in that block has the same treatment while everyone in a different block is assigned a different treatment. This is different in that the intact group is given the treatment rather than randomly assigned to a group. An example would be comparing the instructional methods of two different teachers. Each classroom would represent a block; thus, each class receives a different treatment.   Rigorously Controlled Design carefully assign subjects to different treatment groups, so that those given each treatment are similar in ways that are important to the experiment. An example would be if you want to have a full-time student who is male, takes only night classes, has a full-time job, and has children in one treatment group, then you need to have the same type of student getting the other treatment. This type of design is hard to implement since you don't know how many differentiations you would use. This is more common in medicine.  In a Matched Pairs Design the treatments are given to two groups that can be matched up with each other in some ways. One example would be to measure the effectiveness of a muscle relaxer cream on the right arm and the left arm of individuals, and then for each individual you can match up their right arm measurement with their left arm. Another example of this would be before and after measurement during an experiment, such as weight before and weight after a diet regiment.  "

  "body": " Describing Categorical Data    At the end of this section you will able to     Organize categorical data into a frequency table.    Graph categorical data appropriately.    Accurately describe the data with proportions.     Once a researcher has gathered the data for a particular variable, they need a way to summarize the data in a meaningful way. Generally, the first step is organizing the data and then presenting the data in graphs and charts. A convenient method is organizing the data in a frequency distribution. With categorical data, the frequency represents the number of times a particular category occurs from the raw data. This is organized in a frequency table summarizing each category with its frequency. This works best with nominal and ordinal level data.  On the first day of class, students respond to the Class Survey by identifying their eye color. In the sample of 20 students below, construct a frequency table to summarize the data.   Image of Raw Eye Color Data   Lists 20 eye colors.    The data is organized into 4 distinct categories. With this smaller data set we can count how many have brown eyes, how many have blue eyes, then green and hazel. With a larger data set we will use technology to help us find the frequency. From this sample there are 10 with brown eyes, 4 have blue eyes, 4 have green eyes, and 2 have hazel eyes. If we add the counts together, we get our sample of 20 students.   Image of Eye Frequency   Frequency of 10 brown, 4 blue, 4 green, and 2 hazel.    Once we have the tallies, we can graph the data as a bar graph or bar chart. We typically list the categories along the horizontal x-axis and the frequencies vertically along the y-axis, as shown below. The height of each bar represents the frequency for that category.   Image of Eye Bar Graph   Bar graph showing of 10 brown, 4blue, 4 green, and 2 hazel.    The bar graph allows us to quickly see that brown occurs most often and hazel eyes occurred least often in this sample.  A relative frequency table also shows the proportion or percentage of cases that fall in each category, as shown below.   Image of Eye Relative Frequency Table   Relative frequency table showing of 50% brown, 20% blue, 20% green, and 10% hazel.    The proportion of some category is found by  . Brown eyes occurred 10 times out of the sample of 20 students thus p^=10\/20=.5 which is 50% of the students. Blue eyes occurred 4 times out of the sample of 20 students thus p^=4\/20=.2 which is 20% of the students.  The proportion for a sample is denoted p^ and read \"p-hat.\"  The proportion for a population is denoted p .  Categorical data can also be graphed as pie graph or circle chart. The graph typically includes the percentage for each of the categories.   Image of Eye Circle Graph   Graph showing of 50% brown, 20% blue, 20% green, and 10% hazel.        See the section for Graphing with StatKey for graphing one categorical variable with technology.     Two Categorical Variables   When working with two categorical variables, we often look for possible relationships between the two variables using a two-way table . The categories for one variable are listed down the side (rows) and the categories for the second variable are listed across the top (columns). Each cell of the table contains the count for the number of data cases that are in both categories.  We are going to investigate the possible relationship using the UNC Women's basketball data set. The dataset 22-23 UNCWBB gives the results of the UNC Women's Basketball team for the 31 games played during the 2022-2023 season. Two variables measured within that dataset were Win Loss variable which stated if the UNC team won or lost the game and the HomeAway variable which indicates whether that game was a home game or an away game. The image below is a screen shot of the first nine games from the data set .   Image of partial data set   Lists 9 games as home\/awa and win\/loss.    The results for these variables are shown in the two-way table below. To create the table, in StatKey choose Two Categorical Variables along the left menu and select the variable WinLoss and HomeAway for the table.   Image of WB two-way table   Summarizes value for 31 games.    From the table we can see there were a total of 31 games, 15 of the games were home and 16 games were away. UNC won 13 games and lost 18 games total. They won 8 of the home games and lost 7 at home. They won 5 away games and lost 11 away games.  As a review, is the study an experiment or an observational study?   Solution: This is an observational study since we are looking at recorded data, there was no manipulation of variables.  What proportion of games did the UNC Women's Basketball team win during the 2022-2023 season?   Solution: p(win) = 13\/31 = 0.419 so 42% of the games.  What proportion of games did the UNC Women's Basketball team play at Away during the 2022-2023 season?  Solution: p(away) = 16\/31 = .516 so 51.6% of the games.  Does the UNC Women’s Basketball team have a greater success rate, meaning they win more often, at home games as compared to away games?   Solution: P (win at home) = 8\/15 = .533 = 53.3%   Solution: P (win at away) = 5\/16 = 0.3125 = 31.3%  So it does appear they win more at home.     Side by side bar graph compares the categories next to each other one of the variables. The height of each bar is the number of the corresponding cell in the two-way table.   Segmented bar graph is like a side-by-side bar chart, but the bars are stacked instead of side-by-side. This helps to see the total for each variable across the categories.  The segmented bar graph below list the home and away games along the horizontal axis. The colors represent wins in brown and losses in blue. The heights tell us there were 15 home games an 16 away games. From the graph it shows there were more losses Away since the blue section is larger. UNC had more wins at Home since the brown section is larger for the home games.   Image of WB home and away   Segment bar graph comparing home and away wins.    If we switch the variables on the axes, we have the segmented bar graph below. It is easy to see there were more losses for the season.   Image of WB wins and losses   Segment bar graph comparing wins and losses.    See the section Graphing with StatKey for more information on graphing two categorical variables with technology.  "

  "title": "Descriptive Statistics for Quantitative Variables",
  "body": " Descriptive Statistics for Quantitative Variables   In this chapter we will investigate multiple ways to describe the data with graphs and numerical statistics.     At the end of this section you will able to:     Describe the center of the data with mean, median, mode.    Describe the spread of a data set with range, interquartile-range, and standard deviation.     This section focuses on measures of central tendency. Many times you are asking what to expect \"on average\" or what is a typical value. These types of questions can be answered by knowing the center of the data set. There are three measures of the center of the data. They are the mean, median, and mode.  The mode is the data value that occurs the most frequently in the data. To find it, you count how often each data value occurs, and then determine which data value occurs most often. This is easily seen with a dot plot.  The median is the value in the middle of a sorted list of data. To find it, you put the data in order from smallest to larger, and then determine which data value is in the middle of the data set. If there is an odd number of values, it will land on an actually data value. When there is an even number of values you will need to average the middle two values.  The mean is the arithmetic average of the numbers. You will add all the values together then divide by the number of values.   Sample: A sample of five students have the following number of apps on their cellular phones: 72, 36, 36, 25, 48.   Solution: The mode is 36 since it occurs most often. Since there are five values, the middle value is 25, 36, 36 , 48, 72, thus the median is 36. The mean is the sum of the values divided by 5, thus 217\/5 = 43.4 is the mean apps per person. This is higher than the median because it is skewed to the right by the large value of 72.  A data set can have more than one mode. If there is a tie between two values for the most number of times, then both values are the mode and the data is called bimodal (two modes). If every data point occurs the just once, there is no mode. If there are multiple modes, then it is referred to being multimodal .   Sample: A sample of six students have the following number of apps on their cellular phones: 25, 36, 36, 48, 72, 72.   Solution: This is bimodal with modes of 36 and 72 since both occur twice. Since there are six values, the middle value is (36+48)\/2=42, thus the median is 42. The mean is the sum of the values divided by 6, thus 289\/6 = 48.167 for the mean.  Find the measures of center Find the mode, median, and mean for the data set 4, 5, 6? Mode occurs most often, median is the middle value, for the mean find the sum of the values and divide by the number of values. No mode, median = 5, mean = 5   .   "

Open a web browser and copy   Download the csv file Lab 1 Data.csv posted in Canvas and save to your computer where it is easily accessible. We are going to analyze the students eye colors.  Under the Descriptive Statistics and Graph column on the left, choose the One Categorical Variable .  Click on the Upload File button and locate the data file on your computer.  Identify which variable you will analyze (Eye Color) and click OK. The program constructs a bar graph and frequency table. A sample output image is below.     Interpreting Bar Graphs   From the bar graph we can see that most students have brown eyes and green eyes occur the least often.  From the frequency table we see the sample consisted of 63 UNC students. There are 34 students with brown eyes which is 54% of the class.  Using the graph above, which of the following statements are correct? Select all that apply.  Interpreting information from a graph  Using the graph above, select all true statements that apply to the eye color graph.     Brown eyes occur most often for these students.    This is represented by the tallest bar.      Blue eyes occurred 22.2%    Take the frequency count and divide by the sample size for the percentage.      The sample size is 54 students.    Look at the total from the frequency table.      The distribution is right skewed.    We do not discuss distribution shape with categorical data.     "
