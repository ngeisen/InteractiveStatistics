  "body": " Introduction   A review of terminology to understand statistics.     At the end of this section you will able to:    Identify the cases and variables in a data set.    Distinguish between a sample and a poplulation.    Classify variables as qualitative or quantitative.      You may ask yourself, what is statistics? Will I ever need it? Statistics is all around us. If you are a sports fan, you have heard phrases like average passing yards in a football game, the proportion of free-throws in basketball, or the batting average in baseball. Around election time you hear about polls predicting the president using terms like margin of error. Environmentalists may gather data on arsenic levels in the water of a town or analyze the increasing global temperatures. These are but a few ways statistics is used.   Statistics is the science of conducting studies to collect, organize, analyze and interpret data.  We are going to use an investigative approach to learning about statistics. We will look at different ways of collecting data (such as with surveys and questionnaires). We will organize the data with graphs and tables so we can see what the data tells us at a glance. We will describe the data with numerical summaries (known as statistics) and word descriptions. Later in the semester we will look at other ways to analyze data, such as finding intervals to predict a typical value and compare whether the sample is similar or different from previously known values. We will also investigate if there is an association between variables.  To begin this journey, let us look at some vocabulary commonly associated with statistics.   A case is the unit of observation, typically a person or object that you are interested in finding information about.    A variable is a characteristic that can assume different values, the measurement or observation about the case.     Data are the values or measurements the variables assume.    For example , what are the majors for the students in your class? The major is the variable since there are multiple responses from the students (such as math major, history major, education, nursing, biology major). Other variables you can ask students in your class are their grade level (freshman, sophomore, junior, senior) and the number of credit hours taken this semester. If we asked the students (each student is a case) in class, there will be lots of different answers for the majors (thus the data).     Checkpoint: Dr. Steve Mackessy has been researching snake venom. Suppose he collects data from a sample of 5 snakes. He measures the length and weight of each snake, identifies the species of snake, and the amount of myotoxin A from its venom, if applicable. Identify the cases and variables in this scenario.    Identify the cases  Which of the following are the cases in this scenario? Select all statements that apply.     The five snakes.    Yes, each snake is a case.      The length and weight of the snakes.    The length and weight are variables.      The amount of myotoxin A.    amount of myotoxin A is a variable.       Identify the variables  Which of the following are the variables in this scenario? Select all statements that apply.     The snakes.    No, each snake is a case.      The length and weight of the snakes.    Yes, the length and weight are variables.      The amount of myotoxin A.    Yes, the amount of myotoxin A is a variable.      The name of the species.    Yes, species is a variable since some may be rattlesnakes and some could be bull snakes.     There are two key terms we use to distinguish the groups we collect data from:   The population is the set of all subjects the study is about.    A sample is a group or subset of subjects selected from the population.   If we asked ALL residents of the state of Colorado where they were born, then the Colorado residents would be the population. But if we asked just some people from a single city in the state of Colorado, they would a sample from the state.   Checkpoint: At the Denver Zoo, every animal gets a yearly checkup. The new veterinarian selects 20 female animals to determine if they are pregnant in the spring.    Identify the population  What is the population?     Every animal at the Denver Zoo.    Yes, every animal makes the population.      The 20 female animals.    No, the 20 female animals is the sample.     There are two main branches of statistics that we are interested in.  In descriptive statistics the statistician tries to describe a situation. It consists of collecting, organizing, summarizing and presenting the data.  While with inferential statistics the statisticians make inferences from samples to make predictions about the population. It consists of generalizing data from samples, performing estimations and hypothesis testing, determining relationships among variables, and making predictions.  We will begin with descriptive statistics since we will summarize the data to make the inferences.   Example: According to the Center for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) for the week January 9, 2021, there were 25,974 deaths in the United States attributed to COVID. This is descriptive since it is stating the total deaths.   Example: According to a 2023 Pew Research Center study, approximately 32% of Americans have at least one tattoo. This is inferential since the since they are assuming what is true for the population from a sample study. It is unlikey they asked the entire populuation how many tatoos they have.    Identify if each situation is descriptive or inferential statistics:    Identify if descriptive or inferential statistic  It is estimated that about 9% of the people in the United States have green eyes.     inferential statistic.    Yes, they used a sample to predict the population proportion.      descriptive statistic.    Since they are estimating, its inferential. It is unlikey they asked every US citizen their eye color.     Identify if descriptive or inferential statistic  There are 125 women in the US House of Representatives in 2025.     descriptive statistic.    Yes, its a descriptive statistsic.      inferential statistics.    This is descriptive since it is summarizing the actual count.     Identify if descriptive or inferential statistic  In 2025, 26% of the United States Senators are women.     descriptive statistic.    Yes, since 26 of the 100 senators are women, its descriptive.      inferential statistics.    Since 26 of the 100 senators are women, its descriptive.     There are two main types of data we will be working with:   Qualitative variables are when the data are placed into distinct categories. Such as the color of cars found in a parking lot. The car colors can be classified as white, red, blue, black and other colors.   Quantitative variables are numerical and can be ordered. There are two types of quantitative variables. Discrete variables can be counted, such as the number of cars in the different parking lots across campus. The values are whole numbers. Other numerical variables are continuous variables , meaning any value (decimal or fraction) can occur. These are often obtained by measuring something. A continuous variable could be the length of the cars in the parking lot or the time it takes a car to stop when traveling 20 miles per hour. The numerical value can be something besides a whole number.    Identify the type of variable  Identify which variables are qualitative (categorical). Check all that apply.     The size of drinks at a fast-food restaurant as small, medium, or large.    Yes, since categories of small, medium, large.      Classification of children in a daycare center as infant, toddler, or preschooler.    Yes, since categories given.      The weight of the students in class.    Weight will be a number like 150 pounds.     Identify the type of variable  Identify which variables are quantitative (numerical)     The height of players on the UNC basketball team.    Height is quantitative.      The number of free-throws made during a basketball game.    yes, number of free-throws is quantitative.      The type of candy in the vending machine.    Type of candy is categorical.       Classify the quantitative variable  Identify which quantitative variables are discrete.     Number of muffins purchased each day at a local bakery.    Number of muffins is discrete (cannot sell half a muffin).      The quantity of touchdowns during a football game.    Number of touchdowns is discrete.      The weight of the students in class.    Weight is continuous since someone can weigh 150.3 pounds.     Classify the quantitative variable  Identify which quantitative variables are continuous.     The height of the basketball players.    Height is continuous (6.8 feet tall).      Time to complete the 100 meter breaststroke.    Time is continuous.      The weights of newborn infants at local hospital.    Weight is continuous.      Exercise: In 2010, the Pew Research Center questioned 1500 adults in the U.S. to estimate the proportion of the population favoring marijuana use for medical purposes. It was found that 73% are in favor of using marijuana for medical purposes. Identify the case, variable, type of data collected, population, and sample from this scenario.  Vocabulary Identification  Drag the case, variable, population, and sample to the description from the marijuana scenario.    Cases  Each U.S. adult that responded    Variable  The question “should marijuana be used for medical purposes?”    Population  The set of all adults in the U.S    Sample  The 1500 U.S. adults that responded     Measurement Scales   There are four measurement scales for the different types of data that can be collected. Qualitative variables can be organized as nominal or ordinal data while quantitative variables are either interval or ratio data.   Nominal data is organized by its name into mutually exclusive categories. There is no order to data and one group is not considered better than the others. Examples are gender (classified as male or female), marital status (single, married, widowed, or divorced), and ethnicity are but a few.   Ordinal data is nominal that can be ordered or ranked. Examples are letter grades (A, B, C, D, F) since an A is better than an F, or the winning order in a race (1st, 2nd, 3rd place).   Interval data is numerical where you can add\/subtract one value from another but precise differences between units do not exist. Examples are temperature and IQ scores. A true 0 does not exist with interval data. The temperature outside may be 72 degrees Fahrenheit, but 0 degrees does not mean there is no temperature. We also have negative temperature values.   Ratio data is numerical that can be ordered, there exists a true 0 value, and has consistent units. Most measurements will be ratio. Examples of this are height, weight, distance, and time. For ratio data, a value of 0 means there is no measurement.  Exercises  "

  "title": "Collecting Data",
  "body": " Collecting Data    At the end of this section you will able to:    Simulate several sampling methods.    Recognize the type sampling methods employed in a study.      Recall that the population is the set of all subjects for the study, while a sample is a group or subset selected from the population. It is often difficult or too expensive to examine the whole population for a study, thus we use a sample to help us draw conclusions about the population. When we choose a sample, we want it to be as similar to the population as possible. We are going to simulate several sampling methods using Gettysburg’s Address as the population.  President Abraham Lincoln delivered one of the most famous speeches in United States history at the dedication of the Gettysburg National Cemetery on November 19, 1863. After the featured speaker spoke for two hours, Lincoln delivered his 269-word message in approximately two minutes. Our goal is to estimate the average word length in Abraham Lincoln’s Gettysburg Address by selecting a sample of ten words. The entire text of Lincoln’s Gettysburg Address is given below.   Four score and seven years ago our fathers brought forth, on this continent, a new nation, conceived in Liberty, and dedicated to the proposition that all men are created equal. Now we are engaged in a great civil war, testing whether that nation, or any nation so conceived and so dedicated, can long endure. We are met on a great battlefield of that war. We have come to dedicate a portion of that field, as a final resting place for those who here gave their lives that that nation might live. It is altogether fitting and proper that we should do this. But, in a larger sense, we cannot dedicate—we cannot consecrate—we cannot hallow—this ground. The brave men, living and dead, who struggled here, have consecrated it, far above our poor power to add or detract. The world will little note, nor long remember what we say here, but it can never forget what they did here. It is for us the living, rather, to be dedicated here to the unfinished work which they who fought here have thus far so nobly advanced. It is rather for us to be here dedicated to the great task remaining before us—that from these honored dead we take increased devotion to that cause for which they here gave the last full measure of devotion—that we here highly resolve that these dead shall not have died in vain—that this nation, under God, shall have a new birth of freedom—and that government of the people, by the people, for the people, shall not perish from the earth.   Step 1: Your task is to select a sample of 10 words to estimate the average length of words in his speech. Pick words that appear to be representative of the population of all the words. If you print the address, you can circle the ten words you choose.  Step 2: Find the lengths (number of letters) for each of the 10 words you selected.  Step 3: Calculate the average number of letters for the 10 words in your sample. Take the total number of letters and divide by the 10 words for the average.   Which best describes your average value for the average word length? Your average word length  Which best describes your average value for the average word length?     Between 3 and 6 letters per word.    That is a reasonable estimate.      Less than 3 letters per word.    This estimate is a bit low, there are a lot of large words not included in your sample.      More than 6 letters per word.    This estimate is a bit high, you likely included a lot of the larger words and did not include some of the smaller words     The image below is a class distribution of the average number of letters for the Gettysburg Address by circling ten words. Each dot represents the average value for a student. There were 64 student samples taken. We can see the values range from 3.4 to 9.4 with the center around 5.5 letters per word, thus this will be our predicted value for the typical word length. But it turns out, we are often biased in the words we select. Some students selected bigger words to be representative, others selected more smaller words. Did you notice how many two and three letter words there were? Were you biased in your sampling selection?   Image of Average Word Length from Gettysburg Address   Shows average word length prediction for 64 students clustered between 5 and 6.    Now let’s investigate using a more random approach in selecting the words for a better estimate of the population average.  Randomly choose ten numbers between 1 and 269 and record them. Find the corresponding word in Lincoln’s Gettysburg Address and find the average word length for your new sample.   Image of Gettysburg Address numbered   Image of Gettysburg Address numbered.    You can also use technology to find the random numbers. Try the link for a random number generator at   Go midway down the page to Numbers and select Integer Generator . Generate 10 random integers between 1 and 269. Click on Get Numbers .   Image RandomOrg menu   image of website menu.    The image below is a sample of ten randomly selected numbers using the applet.   Image Sample of random numbers   lists ten random numbers.    Matching these numbers to the corresponding word in Gettysburg Address gives the average of 3.9 letters per word, which is closer to the population mean of 4.29 letters per word. We will look at the distributions again later.   Sample of Gettysburg Address wods   Image of highlighted words.     Sampling bias occurs when the method of selecting a sample causes the sample to differ from the population in some relevant way. If sampling bias exists, we cannot trust generalizations from the sample to the population. So, we need a better method for predicting the typical or average value.  There are many sampling techniques, we will look at some of the more common sampling methods in statistics. We will simulate some of these methods in class with the Gettysburg Address.   Simple Random Sample is a method in which every element in the population has an equal chance of being selected for the sample. It's like putting all the names of the students in class in a hat and randomly drawing ten names.   Systematic Sampling is a method that useful when the population is already ordered in some way and every kth item is selected. While standing in line at a game, every 10th person gets a 10% off coupon. There is a system in how the sample is collected.   Stratified Sampling occurs when the population is divided into natural groups or strata. People are randomly polled in each group and the number of people polled in each group is determined by the ratio of the group to size of the total population. When sampling for how students study, the sample should consist of some freshman, sophomore, juniors, and seniors. If there are twice as many freshman as seniors, then the sample would also have twice as many freshman.   Cluster Sampling is a method that randomly selects a naturally occurring group or cluster and all in that cluster are selected. This is common in education where all of one class is selected to participate in the study. It is helpful to think of a cluster of grapes: you take the whole cluster rather than just grabbing a couple of grapes.   Convenience Sampling occurs when a group of subjects are convenient to sample. Around election time, people stand outside grocery stores to gather an easy sample of people to ask who they will vote for.   Exercise: Identify the type of sampling method described for each scenario:  Sampling Methods Matching Problem  Match the type of sampling method described with the appropriate scenario. Drag the sampling method name to the description.    Systematic Sampling  Alfred is conducting a survey to determine who students will vote for as their next Student Affairs President. He decided to survey students in a dormitory and knocks on every 10th door    Simple Random Sample  Betty is conducting a survey to determine if students like the new plus\/minus grading system. She randomly draws 100 bear numbers from a list and surveys those students.    Stratified Sampling  Charlotte is conducting a survey to determine if students make use of the campus recreation center. She polls 100 freshman, 100 sophomores, 100 juniors, and 100 seniors on how frequently they use the recreation center.    Cluster Sampling  Eugene is conducting a survey to determine if the dorms should have more study break sessions during finals week. He asks everyone on the 5th floor of Turner their opinion.    Convenience Sampling  Douglas is conducting a survey to determine if the University Center should open up a McDonalds, Wendy’s, or Burger King. He stands outside the UC and surveys students as they enter the building.    "

  "body": " Study Types    At the end of this section you will able to:     Appropriately identify as an observation or experimental study.    Correctly identify the explanatory and response variables.     Recall there are two main types of studies:   Observational studies where researchers collect data by watching or asking questions, and draw conclusions based on these observations.   Experimental studies where the researcher manipulates a variable to determine how the treatment influences the other variables.    Identify the type of study described  A researcher decided to check the Greeley Police Department records for 2 months to determine what types of crimes were committed.     Observational study    Yes, an observational study because they are looking at the records, not manipulating a variable.      Experimental study    They are not manipulating a variable.     Identify the type of study described  Identify the type of study described: A sample of 50 men with high triglyceride levels were randomly assigned to two groups: consumed 2 tablespoons of oat bran daily for 6 weeks or consumed 2 tablespoons of wheat bran for 6 weeks, to determine which bran worked better to lower their triglyceride levels.     Experimental study    Yes, they are manipulating a variable.      Observational study    Experimental since they are manipulating a variable.     Many observational studies involve surveys and questionnaires, which uses questions to collect the data for the study. Others look at historical records to collect the data. In educational environment, observations of the participants is how the data is collected, by jotting down notes or videotaping the behaviors.  There are three main types of variables we will look at within an experimental study.  The independent variable is the variable that is being manipulated by the researchers. It is also called the explanatory variable.  The dependent variable is the result of manipulation. It is also called the response variable.  A confounding variable is one that influences the dependent variable but cannot be separated from the independent variable.  For this example, identify the variables. A sample of 50 men with high triglyceride levels were randomly assigned to two groups: one consumed 2 tablespoons of oat bran daily for 6 weeks and the other group consumed 2 tablespoons of wheat bran for 6 weeks, to determine which bran worked better to lower their triglyceride levels.    Identify the type of variable  What variable is the type of bran the participants consumed?     independent variable    Yes, because they want to see if the type of bran influences the triglyceride level.      dependent variable    No, the dependent variable is the resulting triglyceride level.      confounding variable    There were no confounding variable listed, but a person’s diet and health may influence the results.       Identify the type of variable  What variable is the triglyceride levels?     dependent variable    Yes, checking to see if triglyceride level changes.      independent variable    No, the independent variable is the type of bran.      confounding variable    There were no confounding variables listed, but the amount of time a person exercises may influence the results.     Type of bran consumed is the independent variable. They want to determine which one works better in lowering the triglyceride levels.  Whether or not the triglyceride level changes is the dependent variable. This is the result of the of manipulating which type of bran they consumed.  In this case, both bran groups were in the treatment group, there was not control group in the study.  There are several possible confounding variables in this study. Things that could influence the triglyceride levels could be diet, amount of exercise, current healthy, and weight of the participants.  There are many ways experimental studies can be conducted. We will look at some of the most common for this course.  In a Randomized Two-treatment Experiment there are typically two treatments and the individuals are randomly placed into the two groups. Either both groups get a treatment, or one group gets a treatment and the other gets either nothing or a placebo. The group getting either no treatment or the placebo is called the control group . The group getting the treatment is called the treatment group . A doctor may be comparing two different diabetes mediations. The subjects are randomly assigned which medication to use for the study.  The purpose of the placebo is that a person thinks they are receiving the treatment, but in reality, they are receiving a sugar pill or fake treatment. Doing this helps to account for the placebo effect , which is where a person thinks their body responds favorable to a treatment because they are in the study even though they are not really taking the treatment. Not every experiment needs a placebo, such as when working using animals, plants, or children. Also, it is not always possible to use a placebo or no treatment. As an example, if you are testing a new blood pressure medication you cannot give a person with high blood pressure a placebo or no treatment because of health or moral reasons.  In a Randomized Block Design a group of subjects (considered the block) that are similar in some aspects are randomly assigned to a treatment. Everyone in that block has the same treatment while everyone in a different block is assigned a different treatment. This is different in that the intact group is given the treatment rather than randomly assigned to a group. An example would be comparing the instructional methods of two different teachers. Each classroom would represent a block; thus, each class receives a different treatment.   Rigorously Controlled Design carefully assign subjects to different treatment groups, so that those given each treatment are similar in ways that are important to the experiment. An example would be if you want to have a full-time student who is male, takes only night classes, has a full-time job, and has children in one treatment group, then you need to have the same type of student getting the other treatment. This type of design is hard to implement since you don't know how many differentiations you would use. This is more common in medicine.  In a Matched Pairs Design the treatments are given to two groups that can be matched up with each other in some ways. One example would be to measure the effectiveness of a muscle relaxer cream on the right arm and the left arm of individuals, and then for each individual you can match up their right arm measurement with their left arm. Another example of this would be before and after measurement during an experiment, such as weight before and weight after a diet regiment.   Other Considerations   There are other things to consider when designing a study.  A Blind study is where the individual does not know which treatment they are getting or if they are getting the treatment or a placebo.   Double-blind study is where neither the individual nor the researcher knows who is getting which treatment or the placebo. This is important so that there can be no bias created by either the individual or the researcher.  Extercsies  Another consideration is the time period the researcher collected the data over. There are three types of time periods to consider.   Cross-sectional study: The data is observed, measured, or collected at one point in time. After completing the Student Orientation, the participants completed a survey answering questions about how the day went and what events were most useful.   Retrospective study: The data is collected from the past using records, old journals, interviews, and other similar artifacts.  A longitudinal study collects data repeatedly from the same subjects over time, often focusing on a smaller group of individuals that are connected by a common trait. Researchers plan to collect data in the future from these groups.   Example: Suppose you want to study the impact that a low-carb diet has on diabetes. First you gather research on prior studies to see what has already been done. This would be a retrospective study. Then you conduct a cross-sectional study with a sample of diabetes patients to see if there are differences in health outcomes like weight or blood sugar in those who follow a low-carb diet. You discover that the diet correlates with weight loss in younger patients, but not older ones. And then you then decide to design a longitudinal study to further examine this link by collecting data over a period of ten years from a sample of younger patients from a specific clinic.

  "body": " Describing Categorical Data    At the end of this section you will able to     Organize categorical data into a frequency table.    Graph categorical data with bar graph or pie gprah.    Accurately describe the data with proportions.     Once a researcher has gathered the data for a particular variable, they need a way to summarize the data in a meaningful way. Generally, the first step is organizing the data and then presenting the data in graphs and charts. A convenient method is organizing the data in a frequency distribution. With categorical data, the frequency represents the number of times a particular category occurs from the raw data. This is organized in a frequency table summarizing each category with its frequency. This works best with nominal and ordinal level data.  On the first day of class, students respond to the Class Survey by identifying their eye color. In the sample of 20 students below, construct a frequency table to summarize the data.   Image of Raw Eye Color Data   Lists 20 eye colors.    The data is organized into 4 distinct categories. With this smaller data set we can count how many have brown eyes, how many have blue eyes, then green and hazel. With a larger data set we will use technology to help us find the frequency. From this sample there are 10 with brown eyes, 4 have blue eyes, 4 have green eyes, and 2 have hazel eyes. If we add the counts together, we get our sample of 20 students.   Image of Eye Frequency   Frequency of 10 brown, 4 blue, 4 green, and 2 hazel.    Once we have the tallies, we can graph the data as a bar graph or bar chart. We typically list the categories along the horizontal x-axis and the frequencies vertically along the y-axis, as shown below. The height of each bar represents the frequency for that category.   Image of Eye Bar Graph   Bar graph showing of 10 brown, 4blue, 4 green, and 2 hazel.    The bar graph allows us to quickly see that brown occurs most often and hazel eyes occurred least often in this sample.  A relative frequency table also shows the proportion or percentage of cases that fall in each category, as shown below.   Image of Eye Relative Frequency Table   Relative frequency table showing of 50% brown, 20% blue, 20% green, and 10% hazel.    The proportion of some category is found by  . Brown eyes occurred 10 times out of the sample of 20 students thus p^=10\/20=.5 which is 50% of the students. Blue eyes occurred 4 times out of the sample of 20 students thus p^=4\/20=.2 which is 20% of the students.  The proportion for a sample is denoted p^ and read \"p-hat.\"  The proportion for a population is denoted p .  Categorical data can also be graphed as pie graph or circle chart. The graph typically includes the percentage for each of the categories. Pie graphs are useful for comparing the size of the categories. We can see that brown eyes occured most often at 50% for this sample.   Image of Eye Circle Graph   Graph showing of 50% brown, 20% blue, 20% green, and 10% hazel.    A third type of qualitative data graph is a Pareto chart , which is just a bar chart with the bars sorted with the highest frequencies on the left and the smallest frequencies on the right. The advantace is you can visually see the more popular responses to the least popular.    Image of Pareto Chart   Pareto Chart showing of 10 brown, 4 blue, 4 green, and 2 hazel.     See the section for Graphing with StatKey for graphing one categorical variable with technology.     Two Categorical Variables   When working with two categorical variables, we often look for possible relationships between the two variables using a two-way table . The categories for one variable are listed down the side (rows) and the categories for the second variable are listed across the top (columns). Each cell of the table contains the count for the number of data cases that are in both categories.  We are going to investigate the possible relationship using the UNC Women's basketball data set. The dataset 22-23 UNCWBB gives the results of the UNC Women's Basketball team for the 31 games played during the 2022-2023 season. Two variables measured within that dataset were Win Loss variable which stated if the UNC team won or lost the game and the HomeAway variable which indicates whether that game was a home game or an away game. The image below is a screen shot of the first nine games from the data set .   Image of partial data set   Lists 9 games as home\/awa and win\/loss.    The results for these variables are shown in the two-way table below. To create the table, in StatKey choose Two Categorical Variables along the left menu and select the variable WinLoss and HomeAway for the table.   Image of WB two-way table   Summarizes value for 31 games.    From the table we can see there were a total of 31 games, 15 of the games were home and 16 games were away. UNC won 13 games and lost 18 games total. They won 8 of the home games and lost 7 at home. They won 5 away games and lost 11 away games.  As a review, is the study an experiment or an observational study?   Solution: This is an observational study since we are looking at recorded data, there was no manipulation of variables.  What proportion of games did the UNC Women's Basketball team win during the 2022-2023 season?   Solution: p(win) = 13\/31 = 0.419 so 42% of the games.  What proportion of games did the UNC Women's Basketball team play at Away during the 2022-2023 season?  Solution: p(away) = 16\/31 = .516 so 51.6% of the games.  Does the UNC Women’s Basketball team have a greater success rate, meaning they win more often, at home games as compared to away games?   Solution: P (win at home) = 8\/15 = .533 = 53.3%   Solution: P (win at away) = 5\/16 = 0.3125 = 31.3%  So it does appear they win more at home.     Side by side bar graph compares the categories next to each other one of the variables. The height of each bar is the number of the corresponding cell in the two-way table.   Segmented bar graph is like a side-by-side bar chart, but the bars are stacked instead of side-by-side. This helps to see the total for each variable across the categories.  The segmented bar graph below list the home and away games along the horizontal axis. The colors represent wins in brown and losses in blue. The heights tell us there were 15 home games an 16 away games. From the graph it shows there were more losses Away since the blue section is larger. UNC had more wins at Home since the brown section is larger for the home games.   Image of WB home and away   Segment bar graph comparing home and away wins.    If we switch the variables on the axes, we have the segmented bar graph below. It is easy to see there were more losses for the season.   Image of WB wins and losses   Segment bar graph comparing wins and losses.    See the section Graphing with StatKey for more information on graphing two categorical variables with technology.  "

  "body": " Graphing Quantitative Data    At the end of this section you will able to     Accurately graph quantitative data with dotplots, boxplots, and histograms.    Describe the shape of a data distribution.    Describe the center of a data distribution.    Describe the spread of a data distribution.     In this course we will use technology to graph quantitataive data. So our focus will be on interpreting the infomration from the graph. The three graphs we will use the most are dotpltos, boxplots, and histograms.  A dotplot is a graph where the values are listed along the x-axis and each dot reprents the case. The total number of dots represents the sample size. The graph below illustrates the number of tattoos from a sample of studetns.  A histogram is similar to a bar graph, except we generally have continuous data thus the bars touch. We can adjust the width of the bar to create an interval of values, and the frequency of cases that fall in that interval are shown on the y-axis. Histograms are helpful to describe the shape of the distribution.  A boxplot splits the data into four sections with the same number of cases in each region. This helps to see the spread of the values. Boxplot are also known as box-and-whisker plots becasue the box represents the middle 50% of tge data and there is a whisker to the smallest value and a whisker to the largest value.  Another graph you may occasional see is the ogive , also know as the cumulative frequency graph. At the end of each boundary you plot the total number of cases to that point. This is always an increasing fucntion. If you think of your accumulated credit hours for college, if you plot the total number of credits have have completd at the end of each semester you just created an ogive. The graph always starts at zero.   Shapes of Distributions  When we display numerical data in a histogram we often look at its overall shape. If the data has similar frequencies, the bars are about the same size. This is knows as a uniform distribution. The center of the distribution is around the center of the middle intervals.   uniform with equal heights     A distribution the is more bell-shaped, meaning most of the data is in the center with few on the tails and appears symmetric, is refered to as normally distributed. Symmeteric refers to imagining folding the graph in half about the middle and the two sides will align. If one of the tails is longer than the other, we refer to it as being skewed.   symmetric with hump in middle     If the data tends to cluster on the right side, and we see a few values on the left side, this is known as left skewed since the tail goes to the left of the data. This indicates the mean will be left of the median.   left skew     If the data tends to cluster on the left side, and we see a few values on the rigt side, this is known as right skewed since the tail goes to the right of the data. This indicates the mean will be right of the median.   right skew     Sometimes the graph can have multiple bumps showing certain values occur more often than others. This can be an example of bimodal (meaning two values occur more often than others).   bimodal with two humps     See the section for Graphing with StatKey for uploading one quantitative variable into StatKey to graph the data.     Other Graphs  "

  "title": "Descriptive Statistics for Quantitative Variables",
  "body": " Descriptive Statistics for Quantitative Variables   In this chapter we will investigate multiple ways to describe the data with graphs and numerical statistics.     At the end of this section you will able to:     Describe the center of the data with mean, median, mode.    Describe the spread of a data set with range, interquartile-range, and standard deviation.     This section focuses on measures of central tendency. Many times you are asking what to expect \"on average\" or what is a typical value. These types of questions can be answered by knowing the center of the data set. There are three measures of the center of the data. They are the mean, median, and mode.  The mode is the data value that occurs the most frequently in the data. To find it, you count how often each data value occurs, and then determine which data value occurs most often. This is easily seen with a dot plot.  The median is the value in the middle of a sorted list of data. To find it, you put the data in order from smallest to larger, and then determine which data value is in the middle of the data set. If there is an odd number of values, it will land on an actually data value. When there is an even number of values you will need to average the middle two values.  The mean is the arithmetic average of the numbers. You will add all the values together then divide by the number of values.   Sample: A sample of five students have the following number of apps on their cellular phones: 72, 36, 36, 25, 48.   Solution: The mode is 36 since it occurs most often. Since there are five values, the middle value is 25, 36, 36 , 48, 72, thus the median is 36. The mean is the sum of the values divided by 5, thus 217\/5 = 43.4 is the mean apps per person. This is higher than the median because it is skewed to the right by the large value of 72.  A data set can have more than one mode. If there is a tie between two values for the most number of times, then both values are the mode and the data is called bimodal (two modes). If every data point occurs the just once, there is no mode. If there are multiple modes, then it is referred to being multimodal .   Sample: A sample of six students have the following number of apps on their cellular phones: 25, 36, 36, 48, 72, 72.   Solution: This is bimodal with modes of 36 and 72 since both occur twice. Since there are six values, the middle value is (36+48)\/2=42, thus the median is 42. The mean is the sum of the values divided by 6, thus 289\/6 = 48.167 for the mean.  Find the measures of center Find the mode, median, and mean for the data set 4, 5, 6? Mode occurs most often, median is the middle value, for the mean find the sum of the values and divide by the number of values. No mode, median = 5, mean = 5   Find the mean     Find the measures of center   A sample of six students have the following number of apps on their cellular phones: 25, 36, 36, 48, 72, 72    bimodal with modes 36 and 72, median = 42 and mean = 48.167    This is bimodal with modes of 36 and 72 since both occur twice. Since there are six values, the middle value is (36+48)\/2=42, thus the median is 42. The mean is the sum of the values divided by 6, thus 289\/6 = 48.167 for the mean.    "

Determine if outcomes are equally likely.    Compare experimental probabilty with theoretical probabilty.      In this chapter we will learn a little about probability. Many people are familiar with probability from playing games of chance, such as flipping coins, rolling dice and playing cards. We will use several of these examples to help explain the rules of probability.  The questions that probability can help with are your chances that the car you are buying will need more maintenance, your chances of passing a class, your chances of winning the lottery, your chances of being in a car accident. The chance of winning the lottery is very small, yet many people will spend the money on lottery tickets. Yet, if instead they saved the money that they spend on the lottery, they would have more money. In general, events that have a low probability (under 5%) are unlikely to occur. Whereas if an event has a high probability of happening (over 80%), then there is a good chance that the event will happen.  First let us review some definitions to help us understand probability.   Experiment is an activity that has specific results that can occur, but the result is unknown before you begin. Such as flipping a coin.  The outcomes are the results of an experiment. The outcomes from flipping a coin is head or tail.  An event is a set of certain outcomes of an experiment that you want to have happen. So if I want to know the likelihood of getting heads, getting heads is the event I want to happen.  The sample space is the collection of all possible outcomes of the experiment. For a single coin toss the sample space is the same as heads or tails. But if I toss two coins, say a penny and nickel, then the sample space includes all possible outcomes: head on penny and head on nickel, head on penny but tail on nickel, tail on penny with head on nickel, or tails on both penny and nickel. Now there are four outcomes in the sample space.  exerciese  To determine the likelihood of flipping heads, we need to perform the experiment. Suppose you toss a coin 10 times and heads landed up 4 times. Based on this experiment, the probability of getting heads is 4 out of 10 tries or 4\/10 = 2\/5 =.40 or 40%. Probabilities can be written as decimals, fractions, or percentages. Suppose you toss the coin 1000 times and heads occurred 513 times. Thus the probability of heads is now 513\/100 = 51.3% of the time. This is an example of experimental probability since the value was found by actually doing the experiment.  The approximate probability of an event A, written as , is  Most likely you know that the probability of flipping a heads is ½ since there are two sides to the coin. This illustrates theoretical probability which is based on the sample space. But it assumes that all outcomes are equally likely to occur.  "

  "title": "Graphing with R",
  "body": " Graphing with R  In this section we will learn how to do serveral common graphs with R Studio. The commands are the same for R. We will be using R Studio since it has a friendlier interface for beginners.    At the end of this section you will able to:     Use R Studio to graph boxplots and histograms.    Use R Studio to construct bar graphs and circle graphs.    Use R Studio to construct scatterplots.     First, add the Lesson 1 Graphing text file to your Using R Files folder and the Cereal.csv dataset.  You may need to link your Using R Files folder with the working directory, to do this go to the bottom right panel and under the Files tab click on the triple dots … on the far right to locate your folder and click Open . You should now see the Lesson 1 file and the Cereal data in the bottom right panel. Click on the Lesson 1 and it opens in the top left panel so you can copy the R code or you can type it in the bottom left panel.  Next, you will need to import the data file by clicking on the file and select Import Dataset , a new window will open to give you a preview of the spreadsheet and then click on the Import button at the bottom right. Once it is loaded into R Studio, in the bottom left panel type attach(Cereal) so you can call up the variable names.  Now we are all set to start graphing the data. For each scenario, we will start with the most basic graph and then add some aesthetics, such as titles and colors.   Boxplots  Let's begin with boxplots, which split the data into four sections so we can see the spread of the values. We will first analyze the number of calories in each serving of cereal. Type the following command in the bottom left corner. This will construct a vertical boxplot. The graphs will show up in the bottom right panel of R Studio.   boxplot(Calories)    Image of Vertical Boxplot   Boxplot with values from 80 to 214.     Interpreting the Boxplot: The boxplot shows the smallest value at 80 and the largest is 214 (which is unclear on the graph), this gives the range of 214 - 80 = 134 for the total spread. The box represents the quartiles values around 115 and 160 (actual are Q1= 113.2 and Q3 = 160). The box represents the middle 50% of the data values. The interquartile range = Q3-Q1 =160-113.2 = 46.8. The thick line in the middle is the median = 118 . To calculate the actual values use the summary command with the variable name.   summary(Calories)    Image of summary output   summary values of min =80, Q1=113.2, Median=118, Q3=160, Max=214.    Now let's add a label along the x-axis and make the boxplot horizontal.   boxplot(Calories,horizontal = TRUE,xlab = \"Calories per Serving\")  With the horizontal boxplot it is easier to see the right skewness of the data and it is easier to read the quartile values.   Image of horizontal boxplot   horizontal boxplot with values from 80 to 214.    Suppose we want to organize the boxplot by the company that produces each brand of cereal. We will identify the numerical variable first, then the Tilda symbol ~ followed by the categorical variable.   boxplot(Calories~Company)    Image of comparing boxplots   Boxplot for each company.     Comparing Boxplots: With the three boxplots we can see that Company G has an outlier at the top, Company G and K have similar median values while company Q has a larger median. Company Q is more symmetric while Company G and K are skewed.  Next we will add some color to the graph for fun and give the graph a main title. But investigate the amount of fat in each serving. The boxplot is right skewed with several outliers on the right.   boxplot(Fat,horizontal = TRUE, col='blue', border='red',main=\"Fat Content\")    Image of Fat Content Boxplot   Boxplot with colors.           Histograms  Now let us explore the amount of sugar per serving by looking at the shape of the distribution with a histogram.   hist(Sugars)    Image of histogram   Histogram of sugar content.    The default for a range of 20 is 4 rectangles with a width of 5 grams for each interval. Most cereals have between 10 and 15 grams of sugar per serving. With just four rectangles, it can be difficult to describe the shape of the distribution.  Suppose we want to adjust the number of bars in the histogram, we do this by identifying the number of breaks we want. Suppose we want 10 bars instead of the default of four.   hist(Sugars,breaks=10)    Image of histogram   Histogram of sugar content with 10 bars.    This histogram has 10 bars showing more variation in the amount of sugar per serving. This distribution is bimodal.  Next, let us investigate the amount of sodium in each serving and add some labels to the axes and give the graph a main title.   hist(Sodium,breaks=7,xlab='Sodium Content (mg)',ylab='Frequency',main='Histogram for Sodium Content')    Image of histogram for sodium   Histogram of sodium content.    This histogram has nine intervals for the sodium content per serving. The histograms shows a peak at 200 to 250 milligrams of sodium and is more symmetric and bell shaped than the other histograms.    Categorical Graphs     Frequency Table   To construct graphs for categorical data we first need to create a table of the frequencies from the raw data. We will use the table command for the variable Company.   table(Company)   Notice that the categories are G, K and Q. Next we will create a vector I'm calling Brand to create the labels for our future graph using the full company names. Then we will create a Totals vector to list the summarized frequencies. It is important to keep them in the same order.   Brand   c('General Mills', 'Kelloggs', 'Quacker')    Totals   c(13,11,6)       Pie Graph   Now we can construct a simple pie graph for the proportion of cereals by each company. We are listing the numerical Totals first, and the labels = Brand names were created.   pie(Totals, labels=Brand)   Next let us add some brighter colors to the graph and give it a main title.   pie(Totals, labels=Brand, col=rainbow(3), main='Pie Chart of Cereal Companies')    Bar Graph   Now we can construct a simple bar graph for the frequency of cereals by each company. We are listing the numerical Totals first, and the names.arg = Brand names were created.   barplot(Totals, names.arg=Brand)   Next let us add some brighter colors to the graph and give the graph a main title and label the x-axis.   barplot(Totals, names.arg=Brand, cex.names=0.8, col=rainbow(3), xlab='Cereal Brands', ylab='Frequency', main='Bar Graph of Cereal Companies')     Scatterplots   Scatterplots   Now let us construct a simple scatterplot to show the relationship between two quantitative variables. We will use the plot command and identify the x-variable first and then the y-variable.   plot(Fat,Carbs)   To add at title to the graph we add the main= to the command with the title in quotes.   plot(Fat,Carbs,main='Scatterplot of Fat Content and Carbohydrates')   To find the linear correlation coefficient we use the cor command and identify the x-variable first, and then the y-variable. The correlation value should match our scatterplot for how tightly the points form a line. If we see a positive trend in the graph, then the correlation coefficient value will also be positive, and if we see a negative trend in the scatter plot we would expect the correlation value to be negative.   cor(Fat,Carbs)     Quantile Plots   We often look at the shape of the histogram to help us determine if a variable is approximately normal. We can also check the quantile plot which graphs the z-value with the data values. If the quantile plot forms a line it lets us know the variable is approximately normal. If the graph is curved it is typically not normally distribution. We will use the qqnorm command for the quantile plot. We can add the qqline command afterwards to draw a line through the data to see if it appears linear.   qqnorm(Calories)    qqline(Calories)   "

Add the Lesson 2 Statistic text file to your Using R Files folder. We are going to use the same Cereal data set as for graphing data.  You may need to update your working directory , to do this go to the bottom right panel and under the Files tab click on the triple dots on the far right to relocate your file and click Open . You should now see the Lesson 2 file. Click on this and it opens in the top left panel so you can copy the code or you can type it in the bottom left panel.  Next, we will need to import the data file by clicking on file and selecting Import Dataset then click on the Import button at the bottom right. Once the data is loaded into R Studio make sure to use the attach command with the data set name Cereal so you can call up the variable names.   attach(Cereal)   Recall that the commands in R or R studio are all lower case. I tend to use a capital for the first letter of the variables names to help distinguish them.  We will start by looking at some of the summary statistical values for number of calories per serving for a variety of cereal brands.  The most common measures for the center of the distribution are the mean and median. Use the following commands:   mean(Calories)    median(Calories)   To find the measures of spread we look at variance (var) and standard deviation (sd). Use the following commands:   var(Calories)    sd(Calories)  To find the maximum (largest) and minimum (smallest) values use the following commands:   max(Calories)    min(Calories)    Summary of the output: The number of calories per serving has a mean of 133.83 and median of 118. The variance is x.The standard deviation of 34.81 tells us that most values are within 34.81 calories of the mean. The number of calories is between 80 (minimum) and 214 (maximum) per serving. This gives a range of 214 - 80 = 134 calories.  A handy command is a six number summary which contains the typical five-number summary from boxplots and the mean.   summary(Calories)  Sometimes you want the summary for all the variables for the data set. In this case we use summary with the name for the data file which is Cereal    summary(Cereal)   Now repeat the process with one of the other variables. What do these summary statistics tell you about the cereal data set?  "

But first, let us see what the mean of the Calories is per serving.   mean(Calories)  Can we determine if the mean calories is significantly more than 100 calories per serving? The Variable = Calories, the null hypothesis is mu=100, and we are checking if the mean is “greater” than 100 calories. Copy the code into R Studio in the bottom left panel. Make sure to hit [enter] to perform the test. The results will show directly under the command.  t.test(Calories,mu=100,alternative=\"greater\")   Let us determine what the mean fiber is per serving.   mean(Fiber)   Next, test if the mean fiber is less than 2 grams per serving.   t.test(Fiber,mu=2,alternative=\"less\")   What is the mean amount of fat per serving?   mean(Fat)   Test if fat is different than 1 gram per serving with 90% confidence level. Since this is a two tailed test, we will use two.sided as the alternative hypothesis and add the command conf.level = to specify we want 90% precision.   t.test(Fat,mu=1,alternative=\"two.sided\", conf.level = 0.90)     Single Proportion Test  We are going to conduct several proportion tests using the cereal data set. Rather than using the standard z-test for proportions, R Studio does a chi-square test which can be generalized to multiple proportions. The format of prop.test (count x, sample size,p=null value, alternative= ) with a default of 95% confidence for a two-tailed test.  First, find the proportions of each brand of cereal using the table command with the variable name.   table(Company)   The first test is to determine if the proportion of Kellogg cereals is different than 50%. Use the prop.test command with the count of 11 out of the sample of 30 cereals. The null hypothesis is p=.50 and we will use the two-tailed test default.   prop.test(11,30,p=.5)   Next, determine if the proportion of Quaker cereals is less than 50%. Here we need to identify the alternative hypothesis as less with a count of 6 out of 30 cereals.   prop.test(6,30,p=.5, alternative=\"less\")   Now determine if the proportion of General Mills cereal is greater than 1\/3 of the cereals at the 90% confidence level. The alternative hypothesis as greater with a count of 13 out of the 30 cereals. We also need to add the condition conf.level = 0.90 to the command.   prop.test(13,30,p=.333, alternative=\"greater\", conf.level = 0.90)    "

  "body": " Comparison Tests with R  We are going to investigate using R Studio using the same scenarios as in the textbook reading sections for comparing two group.   Comparing Two Independent Means  The standard format for a t.test for the mean is identifying the two variables names separated by commas, the alternative hypothesis as alternative = , and the confidence level using conf.level = with the default being 95%.R Studio finds the difference is u1 - u2 so list them in the order you are calculating them.  For our first example, we are comparing the mean time for completing a maze. Recall the scenario: The time (minutes) it took six white mice to learn to run a simple maze and the times it took six brown mice to learn to run the same maze are given. At alpha = 0.05, does the color of the mice make a difference in their learning rate? The data is in the data file XX  We are going to perform a simple t-test for the difference in mean times. Thus the alternative hypothesis is that the means are not equal. We will using the default settings at 95% level. Import the data set and attach the variable names. We will be using the variables WhiteMice and BrownMice. There are no spaces in the name of variables when using R.   t.test(WhiteMice,BrownMice)   Suppose we claim the average mean time is greater for the white mice using alpha = 0.10 level. We can use White mice is greater than Brown mice or brown mice is less than white mice as shown below, and we need to add conf.level = .90 to both commands.   t.test(WhiteMice,BrownMice,alternative = 'greater',conf.level = .90)    t.test(BrownMice,WhiteMice,alternative = 'less',conf.level = .90)   compare the R outputs    Paired Means  When the data is paired in some way we only look at the difference between those paired values. This is also known as a dependent t-test.  The format I use for the paired t-test is t.test(PostValues, PreValues , paired=TRUE, alternative=, conf.level= ) . The difference is u1 - u2 by default, so list the Post values first so it aligns with the claim better.  A physical education director claims that by taking special vitamins a weight lifter can increase his or her strength. Eight athletes are selected and given a test of strength using the standard bench press. Test the effectiveness of the vitamin regimen at alpha = 0.05. Each value represents the maximum number of pounds the athlete can bench press.  Use the data XX and the variables are WeightAfter and the WeightBefore. Since we are comparing the bench press weights before and after the vitamin regiment, it is a paired or dependent t-test. Enter the following R command to compare the change in weights lifted.   t.test(WeightAfter,WeightBefore, paired=TRUE, alternative='greater', conf.level=.95)     Comparing Two Proportions    Comparing Two Variances  Recall the scenario: The time (minutes) it took six white mice to learn to run a simple maze and the times it took six brown mice to learn to run the same maze are given. At alpha = 0.05, does the color of the mice make a difference in their learning rate? The data is in the data file XX. Only this time we want to compare the variance of time between the white and brown mice. So we are checking if the variance is equal or not equal. We will use the R command var.test and we identify our two variables.   var.test(WhiteMice,BrownMice)   Sometimes when we use a data set, not all values are included. In that case we want to ignore any cells without data. We do this by using na.rm=TRUE. Find the standard deviation for the times for both mice groups.   sd(WhiteMice, na.rm=TRUE)    sd(BrownMice, na.rm=TRUE)    "

  "body": " Correlation Tests with R  Text of section.   Correlation Between Quantitative Variables   Hurricanes   Climate change is a long-term change in the average weather patterns that have come to define Earth’s local, regional, and global climates. Changes observed in Earth’s climate since the early 20th century are primarily driven by human activities, particularly fossil fuel burning, which increases heat-trapping greenhouse gas levels in Earth’s atmosphere, raising Earth’s average surface temperature. One indicator of climate change is the increased frequency of major environmental events, such as hurricanes and tornadoes.  The data in Hurricanes.csv contains the number of hurricanes that made landfall on the eastern coast of the United States from 1914 to 2022. Using R Studio, test to see whether the number of hurricanes is increasing over time is statistically significant.  First, construct a scatterplot to describe the nature of the relationship. Use the plot command and identify the independent x-variable, Years, and the dependent y-variable, Hurricanes. It is also helpful to include a main title.   plot(Year, Hurricanes, main='Hurricanes over the Years’)    Interpret: We can see a slight positive relationship. As the years increase, the number of hurricanes is increasing. About every 20 years we see a cyclical increase in the number of hurricanes.  Second, calculate the correlation coefficient to describe the strength of the relationship. We will use the cor command with the x-variable and y-variable.   cor(Year, Hurricanes)    Interpret: r = .361 indicates a weak positive correlation. But we want to see if this is significance at α = 0.05 level. So we need to perform a correlation test . The default is a two tailed test with a null hypothesis of no correlation and the alternative as significant correlation. Since we have a positive correlation let us see if the positive correlation is significant.   cor.test(Year, Hurricanes,alternative ='greater', conf.level = .95)   Since there is a significant positive correlation for the number of hurricanes over the years, next we should find the regression equation so we can make predictions. We will use the command lm for a linear model and we identify the y-variable, Hurricanes, first with the tilda then the x-variable, Year.   lm(Hurricanes~Year)    Interpret: The y-intercept is -56.00801 and the slope is 0.03144 which gives the regression equation where x represents the year and y represents the predicted number of hurricanes for that year.  We create a Simple Linear Regression Model and then summarize the results for some additional information.   SLRmodelHurr=lm(Hurricanes~Year)    summary(SLRmodelHurr)    Interpret: Tis shows the size of the residuals from the regression line to the actual data points. We can see the correlation test again with t = 4.005 which is statistically significant. The standard error is 2.579. The coefficient of determination means 13% of the variation in the number of hurricanes is accounted for in the model and 87% is due to chance and other variables.
