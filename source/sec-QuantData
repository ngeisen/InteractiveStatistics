<p> In this course we will use technology to graph quantitative data. So our focus will be on interpreting the information from the graph. The three graphs we will use the most are dotplots, boxplots, and histograms.</p>
<p> A <term> dotplot</term> is a graph where the values are listed along the x-axis and each dot represents the case. The total number of dots represents the sample size. The graph below illustrates the number of tattoos for each student from a sample of 43 students.</p>
<image source="DotplotTattoos.png" >

            </image>
<p> <em> Interpret Dotplot: </em> From the dotplot we can see there are 43 dots for the sample of 43 students. Clearly 0 tattoos occur most often (26 students). There are 7 students with 1 tattoo, one student with 2 tattoos, one student with 3 tattoos, four students with 4 tattoos, two students with 5 tattoos. There is one student with 10 and one student with 12 tattoos. The data is from Survey 2</p> 

<p> A <term> histogram </term> is similar to a bar graph, except we generally have continuous data thus the bars touch. We can adjust the width of the bar to create an interval of values, and the frequency of cases that fall in that interval are shown on the y-axis. Histograms are helpful to describe the shape of the distribution. </p>

<p> <em> Interpret Histogram: </em>The histogram created by StatKey shows the weights, in pounds, from a sample of 42 students. The lightest student weight is 115 pounds while the largest weight is 303 pounds. Most students are between 125 and 225 pounds. The width of each interval is 25 pounds creating 9 subdivisions. There are 12 students whose weights are between 150 and 175 pounds. The mean weight is 171.1 pounds. Data found in Survey1. </p>
<p> A <term> boxplot </term> splits the data into four sections with the same number of cases in each region. This helps to see the spread of the values. Boxplot are also known as box-and-whisker plots because the box represents the middle 50% of the data and there is a whisker to the smallest value and a whisker to the largest value. </p>

<p> <em> Interpret Boxplot: </em> The boxplot created by StatKey shows the weights, in pounds, from a sample of 42 students. The minimum student weight is 115 pounds while the maximum weight is 303 pounds. Most students are between 140 and 200 pounds, represented by the box for the middle 50% of the student weights. The middle line represents the median of 163.5 pounds. Data found in Survey 1. </p> 
<p> An <term> outlier </term> is a data value that is much larger or smaller than the rest of the data. This may indicate an unusual value. The student weight of 303 is an outlier as indicated by the star in the boxplot. </p>


<p> Another graph you may occasional see is the <term> ogive</term>, also know as the cumulative frequency graph. At the end of each boundary you plot the total number of cases to that point. This is always an increasing fucntion. If you think of your accumulated credit hours for college, if you plot the total number of credits have have completd at the end of each semester you just created an ogive. The graph always starts at zero. </p>

<p> <term> Shapes of Distributions </term></p>
<p> When we display numerical data in a histogram we often look at its overall shape. If the data has similar frequencies, the bars are about the same size. This is knows as a <term> uniform </term> distribution. The center of the distribution is around the center of the middle intervals. </p>

                <shortdescription> uniform with equal heights</shortdescription>
            </image>
<p>      </p>
<p> A distribution the is more bell-shaped, meaning most of the data is in the center with few on the tails and appears symmetric, is refered to as <term> normally </term> distributed. Symmeteric refers to imagining folding the graph in half about the middle and the two sides will align.  If one of the tails is longer than the other, we refer to it as being skewed.</p>

                <shortdescription> symmetric with hump in middle</shortdescription>
            </image>
<p>      </p>

<p> If the data tends to cluster on the right side, and we see a few values on the left side, this is known as <term> left skewed </term> since the tail goes to the left of the data. This indicates the mean will be left of the median. </p>
<image source="ShapeLeft.png" width="60%">
                <shortdescription> left skew</shortdescription>
            </image>
<p>      </p>

<p> If the data tends to cluster on the left side, and we see a few values on the rigt side, this is known as <term> right skewed </term> since the tail goes to the right of the data. This indicates the mean will be right of the median.</p>

            </image>
<p>      </p>

<p> Sometimes the graph can have multiple bumps showing certain values occur more often than others. This can be an example of <term> bimodal </term> (meaning two values occur more often than others). </p>
