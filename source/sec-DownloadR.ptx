<p> For UNC students only: if you cannot download R and R Studio, you can still access the programs through UNCâ€™s Apporto link. Log in with your UNC credentials. Details can be found in Canvas.  </p> 
<p> Note: For my classes we will be using R Studio since it has a friendlier interface. R Studio will split the screen into 4 panels, each panel has a different purpose. The top left is where you will see the files that are currently open in R Studio. The bottom left panel is where you will type in the commands and see the computational outputs. The top right panel summarizes the variables. The bottom right panel is where you can access the folders, and this is where the graphical output will show. The R commands are the same for both programs. </p>
