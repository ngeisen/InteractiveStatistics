<p> Recall there are two main types of studies: </p>
<p> <term> Observational studies </term> where researchers collect data by watching or asking questions, and draw conclusions based on these observations.</p>
<p>  <term> Experimental studies </term>  where the researcher manipulates a variable to determine how the treatment influences the other variables. </p>
<p>        </p>

•	<statement> <p> Identify the type of study described: A sample of 50 men with high triglyceride levels were randomly assigned to two groups:  consumed 2 tablespoons of oat bran daily for 6 weeks or consumed 2 tablespoons of wheat bran for 6 weeks, to determine which bran worked better to lower their triglyceride levels.   </p> </statement>

<p> Many observational studies involve surveys and questionnaires, which uses questions to collect the data for the study. Others look at historical records to collect the data. In educational environment, observations of the participants is how the data is collected, by jotting down notes or videotaping the behaviors. </p>

<p> There are three main types of variables we will look at within an experimental study. </p>
<p> The <term>  independent variable </term>  is the variable that is being manipulated by the researchers.  It is also called the explanatory variable. </p>
<p> The <term> dependent variable </term>  is the result of manipulation.  It is also called the response variable. </p>
<p> A <term> confounding variable </term>  is one that influences the dependent variable but cannot be separated from the independent variable. </p>

<p> For this example, identify the variables. A sample of 50 men with high triglyceride levels were randomly assigned to two groups:  one consumed 2 tablespoons of oat bran daily for 6 weeks and the other group consumed 2 tablespoons of wheat bran for 6 weeks, to determine which bran worked better to lower their triglyceride levels. </p>

<p> Type of bran consumed is the independent variable. They want to determine which one works better in lowering the triglyceride levels. </p>
<p> Whether or not the triglyceride level changes is the dependent variable. This is the result of the of manipulating which type of bran they consumed. </p>
<p> In this case, both bran groups were in the treatment group, there was not control group in the study. </p>
<p> There are several possible confounding variables in this study. Things that could influence the triglyceride levels could be diet, amount of exercise, current healthy, and weight of the participants. </p>

<p>There are many ways experimental studies can be conducted. We will look at some of the most common for this course.</p>
<p> In a <term> Randomized Two-treatment Experiment </term>  there are typically two treatments
and the individuals are randomly placed into the two groups. Either both groups get a
treatment, or one group gets a treatment and the other gets either nothing or a placebo.
The group getting either no treatment or the placebo is called the <em>control group </em>. The
group getting the treatment is called the <em> treatment group </em>. A doctor may be comparing two different diabetes mediations. The subjects are randomly assigned which medication to use for the study. </p>
<p> The purpose of the placebo is that a person thinks they are receiving the treatment, but in reality, they are receiving a sugar pill or fake treatment. Doing this helps to account for the <em> placebo effect </em>, which is where a person thinks their body responds favorable to a treatment because they are in the study even though they are not really taking the treatment. Not every experiment needs a placebo, such as when working using animals, plants, or children. Also, it is not always possible to use a placebo or no treatment. As an example, if you are testing a new blood pressure medication you cannot give a person with high blood pressure a placebo or no treatment because of health or moral reasons. </p>
<p> In a <term> Randomized Block Design </term> a group of subjects (considered the block) that are similar in some aspects are randomly assigned to a treatment. Everyone in that block has the same treatment while everyone in a different block is assigned a different treatment. This is different in that the intact group is given the treatment rather than randomly assigned to a group.
An example would be comparing the instructional methods of two different teachers. Each classroom would represent a block; thus, each class receives a different treatment. </p>
<p> <term>Rigorously Controlled Design </term> carefully assign subjects to different treatment groups, so that those given each treatment are similar in ways that are important to the
experiment. An example would be if you want to have a full-time student who is male,
takes only night classes, has a full-time job, and has children in one treatment group, then
you need to have the same type of student getting the other treatment. This type of
design is hard to implement since you don't know how many differentiations you would
use. This is more common in medicine. </p>
<p> In a <term> Matched Pairs Design </term> the treatments are given to two groups that can be matched up with each other in some ways. One example would be to measure the effectiveness of a muscle relaxer cream on the right arm and the left arm of individuals, and then for each
individual you can match up their right arm measurement with their left arm. Another example of this would be before and after measurement during an experiment, such as weight before and weight after a diet regiment. </p>

<p> <term> Other Considerations </term> </p>
<p> There are other things to consider when designing a study. </p> 
<p> A <term>Blind study </term> is where the individual does not know which treatment they are getting or if they are getting the treatment or a placebo. </p>
<p> <term> Double-blind study </term> is where neither the individual nor the researcher knows who is getting which treatment or the placebo.  This is important so that there can be no bias created by either the individual or the researcher. </p>
<p> Exercides </p> 

    <p> Another consideration is the time period the researcher collected the data over.  There are three types of time periods to consider. </p> 

<p> <term> Cross-sectional study:</term>  The data is observed, measured, or collected at one point in time. After completing the Student Orientation, the participants completed a survey answering questions about how the day went and what events were most useful.  </p>

<p> <term> Retrospective study:</term> The data is collected from the past using records, old journals, interviews, and other similar artifacts. </p>
<p>A <term>longitudinal study </term> collects data repeatedly from the same subjects over time, often focusing on a smaller group of individuals that are connected by a common trait. Researchers plan to collect data in the future from these groups. </p>
<p> <em> Example:</em> Suppose you want to study the impact that a low-carb diet has on diabetes. First you gather research on prior studies to see what has already been done. This would be a retrospective study. Then you conduct a cross-sectional study with a sample of diabetes patients to see if there are differences in health outcomes like weight or blood sugar in those who follow a low-carb diet. You discover that the diet correlates with weight loss in younger patients, but not older ones. And then you then decide to design a longitudinal study to further examine this link by collecting data over a period of ten years from a sample of younger patients from a specific clinic. </p>
