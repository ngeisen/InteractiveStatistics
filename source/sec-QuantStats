        This section focuses on measures of central tendency. Many times you are asking what
to expect "on average" or what is a typical value. These types of questions can be answered by knowing the center of the
data set. There are three measures of the <term> center </term> of the data. They are the mean, median, and mode.
      </p>
      <p>  
        The <term> mode </term> is the data value that occurs the most frequently in the data. To find it, you count how often each data value occurs, and then determine which data value occurs
        most often. This is easily seen with a dot plot.
     </p> 
     <p>
        The <term> median </term> is the value in the middle of a sorted list of data. To find it, you put the data in order from smallest to larger, and then determine which data value is in the middle of the data set. If there is an odd number of values, it will land on an actually data value. When there is an even number of values you will need to average the middle two values.
     </p>
     <p> The <term> mean </term> is the arithmetic average of the numbers. You will add all the values together then divide by the number of values. </p>
        
     <p> <term> Sample: </term> A sample of five students have the following number of apps on their cellular phones: 72, 36, 36, 25, 48. </p>
    <p> <term> Solution: </term> The mode is 36 since it occurs most often. Since there are five values, the middle value is 25, 36, <c> 36 </c>, 48, 72,  thus the median is 36. The mean is the sum of the values divided by 5, thus 217/5 = 43.4 is the mean apps per person. This is higher than the median because it is skewed to the right by the large value of 72. </p> 
    
    <p> A data set can have more than one mode. If there is a tie between two values for the most
        number of times, then both values are the mode and the data is called <em> bimodal </em> (two
        modes). If every data point occurs the just once, there is no mode. If there are multiple modes, then it is referred to being <em> multimodal </em>. </p>
       
 <p> The <term> range </term> of a data set is the difference between the largest and the smallest data values (also known as the maximum and minimum values). This lets us know how spread apart the extreme values of the data are. </p>      
    <p> <term> Sample: </term> A sample of six students have the following number of apps on their cellular phones: 25, 36, 36, 48, 72, 72. </p>
    <p> <term> Solution: </term> This is bimodal with modes of 36 and 72 since both occur twice. Since there are six values, the middle value is (36+48)/2=42,  thus the median is 42. The mean is the sum of the values divided by 6, thus 289/6 = 48.167 apps per phone. The range is 72 - 25 = 47 apps, which represents the spread in the number of apps on these phones. </p>

        <statement><p>Find the mode, median, and mean for the data set 4, 5, 6?</p></statement>
        <hint><p> Mode occurs most often, median is the middle value, for the mean find the sum of the values and divide by the number of values.</p></hint>
        <answer><p> No mode, median = 5, mean = 5 </p> </answer>
        <solution>
          <p> Find the mean <m>(4+5+6)/3=5 </m> </p>

<example>
  <title>Find the measures of center</title>
  <statement>
    <p>   A sample of six students have the following number of apps on their cellular phones: 25, 36, 36, 48, 72, 72      </p>
  </statement>
  <answer>
    <p>  bimodal with modes 36 and 72, median = 42 and mean = 48.167  </p>
  </answer>
  <solution>
    <p>       This is bimodal with modes of 36 and 72 since both occur twice. Since there are six values, the middle value is (36+48)/2=42, thus the median is 42. The mean is the sum of the values divided by 6, thus 289/6 = 48.167 for the mean.</p>
