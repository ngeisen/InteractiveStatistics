  <title>Understanding the Basics</title>
<p> Another type of probability distribution that is created when there are just two events is the binomial probability distribution.  </p>
<p> A <term>binomial event </term> contains <em> two</em> outcomes: such as male or female, you either win or lose a game, a test question is either true or false. </p>
<p> A <term>binomial experiment </term> is a probability experiment that satisfies the following four requirements: </p>
<ol>
<li> <p> There must be a fixed number of trials. This means that the experiment is repeated a specific number of times. </p> </li> 
<li> <p> Each trial has only two outcomes (or can be reduced to the two outcomes of success and failure). </p> </li>
<li> <p> The outcomes of each trial must be independent of each other. what happens on one trial does not influence the outcomes of other trials. </p> </li>
<li> <p> The probability of success must remain the same for each trial. </p> </li>
</ol> 

<p> Some notations we will be using for the binomial experiments: </p>
<p> <m>P(S) </m> is probability for success </p>
<p> <m>P(F) </m>  is probability of failure </p>
<p> The numerical probability of success is <m>p</m>  </p>
<p> The numerical probability of failure is <m>q = 1 -p </m>   </p>
<p> <m>n </m> is the number of trials in the experiment </p>
<p> <m>X</m>  is the number of successes in <m>n</m> trials </p>

<p> <term> Deriving the Binomial Probability Formula </term> </p> 
<p> Suppose you are given a 3-question multiple-choice test. Each question has 4 responses and only one is correct. Suppose you want to find the probability that you can just guess at the answers and get 2 questions right. To help with the idea that you are going to guess, suppose the test is in Martian writing. </p> 
<p> Let <m>x</m> = number of correct answers</p> 

<example> 
<title>  Check binomial experiment </title> 
<statement>  
<ol>
<li> <p> There must be a fixed number of trials. </p> </li> 
<li> <p> Each trial has only two outcomes. </p> </li>
<li> <p> The outcomes independent of each other. </p> </li>
<li> <p> The probability of success must remain the same for each trial. </p> </li>
</ol>
</statement>  
<solution> 
<p> There are 3 questions, and each question is a trial, so there are a fixed number of trials. In this case, n = 3. </p> </solution> 
<solution>  <p> Getting the first question right has no affect on getting the second or third question right, thus the trials are independent. </p> </solution>
<solution>  <p> Either you get the question right or you get it wrong, so there are only two outcomes. In this case, the success is getting the question right. </p> </solution>
<solution>  <p> The probability of getting a question right is one out of four. This is the same for every trial since each question has 4 responses. In this case, <m>p = ¼ </m> and <m> q = 1− ¼ = ¾ . </m> </p>
<p>This is a binomial experiment, since all of the properties are met. </p>
</solution> 
</example> 
<example> 
<title>  Getting exactly two correct </title> 
<statement>  <p> First we need to find the sample space to determine how many ways to get exactly two correct answers out of three choices. Then we can find the probability of getting 2 correct answers. </p> 
 </statement>  
<solution> <p>
Let's start with finding the sample space. We are going to let R represent the right answer was chosen and W represents the wrong answer was chosen. Using a tree diagram we can find the sample space</p>
<p> Sample space = {RRR, RRW, RWR, WRR, WWR, WRW, RWW, WWW}, where RRW
means you get the first question right, the second question right, and the third question wrong. The same is similar for the other outcomes. </p> 
<p> There are <term>three </term> ways to get 2 right answers which are {RRW, RWR, WRR}.  </p> </solution> 
</example> 
<example> 
<title>  Probability exactly two correct </title> 
<statement>  <p> Find the probability of getting 2 correct answers in three questions. </p> 
 </statement>  
<solution> <p>
Next, we need to determine the probability of getting exactly two right. </p>
<p> Look at just P(RRW) for the moment. Again, that means P(RRW) = P(R on 1st, R on 2nd, and W on 3rd). Since the trials are independent, P(RRW)= P(R on 1st) * P(R on 2nd) * P(W on 3rd) thus we just multiply p * p * q </p>
<p> P(RRW) = (1/4)(1/4)(3/4) which is the same as <m>(1/4)^2 (3/4)^1 </m> </p> 
<p> The same is true for P(RWR) and P(WRR).  </p>
<p> To find the probability of the 3 ways to get 2 correct answers, just add these three probabilities together. You get <m>3(1/4)^2 (3/4)^1 =.140625</m> </p> 
</solution>
</example> 
<example> 
<title>  Generalize  </title> 
<statement>  <p> Generalizing the pattern we can determine the probability of each event and the number of ways to get exactly X correct </p> 
 </statement>  
<solution> <p>
Generalizing the pattern, we can determine the probability of each event with the number of ways to get exactly X correct answers from the sample space. There is 1 way to get 0 right, 3 ways with 1 right, 3 ways with 2 right, and 1 way with 3 right answers.  Since the probability of the right answer is ¼ that is raised to the number of correct answers in the three questions and the ¾ is raised to the number of wrong answers. </p>

 <p> The outcomes of a binomial experiment and the corresponding probabilities of these outcomes is called a <term> binomial distribution. </term> </p> 

<definition xml:id="def-BinomialFormula">
            <statement>    
<p> The <term> Binomial Probability Formula </term>  for exactly X successes in n trials is <me> P(X)=\frac{n!}{(n-X)!\cdot X!}\cdot\ p^X\cdot\ q^{n-X} </me> </p>         </statement>
        </definition>

 <note> <p> See how the first part of the binomial formula for the number of ways the event occurs is the same as the combination formula for nCr .  Also note that the sum of the exponents equals <m> n</m> for the total number of trials. </p> </note> 
   
 <p> <term> Application </term> </p> 
<p>During the first week of class, we investigated the eye colors of students. About 2% of the world population has green eyes and about 9% of the US population has green eyes. Consider a group of 20 people who were randomly selected from the US. </p>
<p>Let x = number of people with green eyes</p> 
<example> 
<title>  Binomial experiment </title> 
<statement> <p>  Check if this is a binomial experiment. </p>
</statement>  
<solution> 
<p> 1. There are 20 people, and each person is a trial, so there are a fixed number of trials. In this case, n = 20. </p>
<p> 2. If you assume that each person in the group is chosen at random the eye color of one person doesn't affect the eye color of the next person, thus the trials are independent. </p>
<p> 3. Either a person has green eyes or they do not have green eyes, so there are only two outcomes. In this case, success is a person who has green eyes. </p>
<p> 4. The probability of a person having green eyes is 0.09 in the US. This is the same for every trial since each person has the same chance of having green eyes. <m>p = 0.09</m> and <m>q = 1− 0.09 = 0.91</m> </p>
</solution>
</example> 

<example> 
<title>  None green </title> 
<statement> <p>  Find the probability that none in the group will have green eyes. </p>
</statement>  
<solution> 
<p> To find the number of ways 0 people have green eyes in a group of 20 people is <m> _{20} C_0 = 1</m>. Thus <m>P(x=0) = 1(.09)^0 (.91)^{20} = 0.1516 </m> </p>
</solution>
</example> 

<example> 
<title>  One green </title> 
<statement> <p>  Find the probability that exactly one person in the group will have green eyes. </p>
</statement>  
<solution> 
<p> To find the number of ways 1 person has green eyes in a group of 20 people is <m> _{20} C_1 = 20</m> ways. Thus <m>P(x=1) = 20(.09)^1 (.91)^{19} = 0.3000 </m> </p>
</solution>
</example> 

<example> 
<title>  Two green </title> 
<statement> <p>  Find the probability that exactly two people in the group will have green eyes. </p>
</statement>  
<solution> 
<p> To find the number of ways 2 people have green eyes in a group of 20 people is <m> _{20} C_2 = 190</m> ways. Thus <m>P(x=2) = 190(.09)^2 (.91)^{18} = 0.2818 </m> </p>
</solution>
</example> 

<example> 
<title>  Three green </title> 
<statement> <p>  Find the probability that exactly three people in the group will have green eyes. </p>
</statement>  
<solution> 
<p> To find the number of ways 3 people have green eyes in a group of 20 people is <m> _{20} C_3 = 1140</m> ways. Thus <m>P(x=3) = 1140(.09)^3 (.91)^{17} = 0.1672 </m> </p>
</solution>
</example> 

<p> We can also find the probability of multiple events by finding the binomial probability of each event and adding them together. </p> 
<example> 
<title>  One or Two </title> 
<statement> <p>  Find the probability that exactly one or two people in the group will have green eyes. </p>
</statement>  
<solution> 
<p> Previously we found <m>P(x=1)= 0.3000 </m> and <m>P(x=2)= 0.2818</m>,  therefore P(1 or 2)<m>=0.3000+0.2818 =0.5818</m> </p>
</solution>
</example> 

<example> 
<title>  Less than three </title> 
<statement> <p>  Find the probability that less than 3 people in the group will have green eyes. </p>
</statement>  
<solution> 
<p> Since we want less than three we write it as <m>P(x \lt 3) = P(0)+P(1)+P(2)</m>. We do not count when <m>x=3</m>. Previously we found <m>P(x=0)= 0.1516 </m> and <m>P(x=1)= 0.3000</m>  and<m> P(x=2)= 0.2818</m>,  therefore P(0 or 1 or 2) <m>= 0.1516 +0.3000+0.2818 =0.7334 </m></p>
</solution>
</example> 

<p>Sometimes using the complement helps us find the total probability.</p>
<example> 
<title>  More than two </title> 
<statement> <p>  Find the probability that more than 2 people in the group will have green eyes. </p>
</statement>  
<solution> 
<p> Since we want more than 2 we can write it as <m>P(x \gt 2) = P(3)+P(4)+…+(19)+P(20)</m>. We would need to find the probability of each event. Way too much work. So instead, use the complement which becomes <m>P(x \gt 2) = 1- (P(0)+P(1)+P(2))</m>. Previously we found <m>P(x \lt 2)= 0.1516 +0.3000+0.2818 =0.7334</m>, therefore <m>1-0.7334 = 0.2666</m>. Which is much easier. </p>
</solution>
</example> 

<example> 
<title>  At most 18 </title> 
<statement> <p>  Find the probability that at most18 people in the group will have green eyes. </p>
</statement>  
<solution> 
<p> Since we want at most 18 we can write it as <m>P(x \le 18) = P(0)+P(1)+…+(16)+P(17)+P(18)</m>. At most includes P(18). Using the complement, the expression becomes <m> 1-(P(19)+P(20))</m>. <m>P(19)= 20(.09)^{19} (.90)^1 = 2.46 \times 10^{-19}</m> and <m>P(20)= 1(.09)^{20} (.90)^0 = 1.22 \times 10^{-21} </m>, note these are in scientific notation and basically 0. Therefore<m> P(x \le18)=  1-0.0000 = 1</m>. Therefore it’s very likely that at most 18 will have green eyes. </p>
</solution>
