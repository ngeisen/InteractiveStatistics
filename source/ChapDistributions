  <title>Distributions</title>

  <introduction>
    <p> Previously we discussed obtaining sample data from the population of interest. In this chapter we are working in the other direction. We will be using information in the sample to understand what is true about the population. So, we are going to shift from descriptive statistics to inferential statistics.  </p>
